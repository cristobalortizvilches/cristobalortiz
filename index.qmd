I am a sociologist from the University of Chile and hold a Master’s degree in Urban Development from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. My research explores the effects of sociospatial inequality on household decision-making and collective ties. To address these questions, I draw on critical urban sociology and use programming and statistical tools in RStudio.
